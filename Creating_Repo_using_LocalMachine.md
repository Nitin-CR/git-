In VS code we use the command

```
git init
```
we create a new Markdown file 

and then 

```
git add readme.md
```
To push this live
We have to create a new repository in Github and then on the VS code terminal

```
git remote add origin 'repo link'
```
and then to push it

```
git push - u origin master
```
