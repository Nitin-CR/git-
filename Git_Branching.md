* A pull request is a request to pull your code into an other branch.

* After making a PR we can update the code as long as it is in thesame branch.
* Once it is merged with the master branch, To make changes we have to create a new branch and repeat it all.


```
git branch -d (name)
```
It deletes the branch.

To fix merge conflict we can either use github or the terminal but the easiest way is to do it is in a code editor.
